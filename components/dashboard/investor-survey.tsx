                <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">General Risks of Trading and Investing</h3>
                <p>
                  All securities trading, whether in stocks, exchange-traded funds ("ETFs"), options, closed-end funds
                  ("CEFs") or other investment vehicles, is speculative in nature and involves substantial risk of
                  loss. Auto Investment Broker encourages its Customers to invest carefully and to use the information
                  available at the websites of the SEC at http://www.sec.gov and FINRA at http://FINRA.org.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">1. You may lose money trading and investing.</h3>
                <p>
                  Trading and investing in securities is always risky. For that reason, Customers should trade or
                  invest only with money they can afford to lose. Trading stocks, ETFs and stock options involves HIGH
                  RISK, and YOU can LOSE a lot of money. Margin trading involves interest charges and additional
                  risks, including the potential to lose more than deposited or the need to deposit additional
                  collateral in a falling market.
                </p>
              </div>

                <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">2. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.</h3>
                <p>
                  All investments carry risk, and all trading decisions of an individual remain the responsibility of
                  that individual. There is no guarantee that systems, indicators, or trading signals will result in
                  profits or that they will not result in losses. All Customers are advised to fully understand all
                  risks associated with any kind of trading or investing they choose to do.

                  Neither Auto Investment Broker nor its affiliates provide investment advice. All Auto Investment
                  Broker brokerage accounts are self-directed, and unless Auto Investment Broker clearly identifies a

                <p>
                  A stop market order is an order, placed with your broker, to buy or sell a particular stock at the
                  market price if and when the price reaches a specified level. There can be no guarantee, however,
                  that it will be possible under all market conditions to execute the order at the price specified. In
                  an active, volatile market, the market price may be declining (or rising) so rapidly that there is no
                  opportunity to liquidate your position at the stop price you have designated.

                <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Risks of Investing in Stocks, ETFs, and CEFs</h3>
                <p className="mb-2">Investments always entail some degree of risk. Be aware that:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                  <li>
                    Some investments in stock cannot easily be sold or converted to cash. Check to see if there is any
                    penalty or charge if you must sell an investment quickly.
                  </li>
                  <li>Stock investments are not federally insured against a loss in market value.</li>
                  <li>
                    There is a risk when buying shares of stock that the value of the stock can fall to zero. Short
                    selling involves substantial risk and assumes the seller will be able to buy the stock at a more
                    favorable price than the price at which they sold short.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ETFs are subject to risks similar to those of other diversified portfolios. Leveraged and Inverse
                    ETFs may not be suitable for all investors and may increase exposure to volatility through the use
                    of leverage, short sales of securities, derivatives and other complex investment strategies.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    CEFs involve unique risks. Unlike ETFs, CEFs trade on exchanges at market prices that may be
                    higher ("premium") or lower ("discount") than their net asset value ("NAV"). Many CEFs employ
                    structural or portfolio leverage, which magnifies both gains and losses.
